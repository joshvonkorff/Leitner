## How to use the Leitner csv files

The purpose of this file is to help you learn and memorize some common Python functions used for data science.  It is essentially a set of flashcards.

Of course, memorizing these functions does not substitute for learning what they mean and practicing their use; for this, you will need a good course or program in data science.  (I am learning through the K2 program.)

The "Leitner" strategy is a means of memorizing anything in a systematic way.  The insight is that data can be retained in your long term memory by refreshing it from time to time.  The better you know a fact, the less often it has to be refreshed.

The csv files here have several columns: (1) a topic, such as "visualization," (2) a # within that category, (3) a query (clue or cue), (4) an answer.

To use this, shuffle the rows randomly using Excel or another program that can perform the shuffle.  Cover up the answers, and try to figure them out based on the cues.  Make a new column to keep track of your progress.  In this new column, add a 0 if you do not want to work on this row, a 1 if you are working on it but have not learned it yet, and a 2 if you have memorized it.  You can sort the columns by this "progress number" to ensure that you see the kinds of rows you want.  Come back to the 2's a week or a month later to make sure you still know them; if you do, they can graduate to become 3's, at which point the interval will be even longer.

To un-shuffle the rows, simply sort them by the category and # again.
